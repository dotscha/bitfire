# bitfire
Bitfire is a fixed interleave loadersystem for c64 with depacker, a basic framework and an image writing tool.

This fork is created as an attempt to create a plus/4 port of the system. We also added a save routine to the package for the request of game developers.

Supported drives: all 1541 compatible and 1551

Protocolls: 1541 2bit ATN (so no second drive is allowed on bus), 1551 8bit
